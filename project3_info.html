            This project was created for my Human Computer Interaction class. This class focuses on the 
            interaction between machines and the people who use them. The course focused on accesability and 
            desgining websites that everybody is able to use, regardless of how they choose to view (or hear) 
            the webpage. 
        </p>

            For this project I created a mock music player. While it does not actually play music, it exhibits 
            all the functionality of a typical music player. For example click on Chance The Rapper's album to view the songs included.
            Clicking on the first song will bring up a music player, which will count down the reamining time,
            is able to pause and play, and will skip to the next song. 
        </p>

            This was one of my first projects using JavaScript functions to dynamically change the content displayed 
            on the page. For example when the pause or play button is clicked, it switches to the opposite (if paused will display the play button
            and vice versa). It really opened my eyes to the possibilites that JS adds to webpages, and gave me good 
            insight into how to design a simple application interface.
